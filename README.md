# EdTech-Dashboard
This project involves the development of a Power BI dashboard designed specifically for an EdTech startup. The primary goal was to transform raw data into an accessible visual format, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions. The dashboard showcases advanced data analysis techniques and a deep understanding of both numerical and categorical data.

To achieve this, a user-friendly interface was created, integrating intuitive charts, graphs, and KPIs. The design focused on clarity and usability, ensuring that even non-technical users could extract valuable insights. The work required cleaning, transforming, and preprocessing data, which was accomplished using Power Query (M language). This process streamlined workflows and automated repetitive tasks, contributing to overall efficiency.

Furthermore, advanced logic-building skills were employed to handle complex datasets and establish robust models that facilitated dynamic reporting. The project highlighted expertise in solving intricate problems and writing effective queries, which played a key role in delivering actionable insights. These insights helped the startup identify top-performing courses, monitor instructor ratings, and evaluate customer acquisition trends.

In summary, this project not only reflects technical proficiency in Power BI but also demonstrates the ability to align data analytics with business objectives. It has successfully added value by providing clear, actionable insights that enhance decision-making processes within the organization.
